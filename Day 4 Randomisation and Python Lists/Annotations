Randomisation allow fun stuff!!!
Python usese a quasi random generator called Mersenne Twister 
Khan Academy has a good video on it https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/random-number-generation

You import the random module with
import random

a python module is a file that contains python code that you can import into your program to use

You can use random.randint(a,b) to get a random integer between a and b
You can use random.random() to get a random float between 0 and 1
You can use random.choice(list) to get a random element from a list
You can use random.shuffle(list) to shuffle a list
You can use random.sample(list, k) to get k random elements from a list
You can use random.uniform(a,b) to get a random float between a and b
You can use random.seed() to set the seed of the random generator
You can use random.getstate() to get the state of the random generator
